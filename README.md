## Steps in phylogenetic analysis

### Initial manual step of downloading sequence accession list
Manually download 229E sequences from [NCBI Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/).

To do this, go to the [NCBI Virus website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/), click *Search by virus*, and then enter *Human coronavirus 229E* (taxid:1137) in the *Search by virus name or taxonomy* box and hit return.
Then under *Refine Results*, click *Host* and enter *Homo sapiens*.
Then click *Download*, select *CSV format* under *Current table view results*, hit *Next*, hit *Next* again (it should show *Download all records*), and enter choose *Select All* for the columns to include.
Then save the file as [data/Genbank_229E_accessions.csv](data/Genbank_229E_accessions.csv).
