# Analysis of neutralization assay data for seasonal antigenic drift project

### Converting excel file from the plate reader to csv file with fraction infectivities

##### I use Kate's `excel_to_fractinfect.py` script to calculate the fraction infectivities. Each input and output file, and sample map file is grouped by the date that the plates were read on the plate reader.  

##### Note that the 02Oct20 samples were set up differently than we usually doâ€” I instead used the top row to test eight dilutions instead of seven. Consequently, I wasn't able to use the script to calculate the fraction infectivities and instead had to calculate them by hand.
